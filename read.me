# CSV Linear Regression Analysis

This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload CSV files and perform linear regression analysis on the data. The application uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret user queries and identify the dependent and independent variables for the regression analysis.

## Features

- Upload CSV files containing your data.
- Enter natural language queries to perform linear regression analysis.
- The LLM interprets the query to determine the dependent and independent variables.
- The application displays the regression equation, model summary, and predictions.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file to store your OpenAI API key:**

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).**

3. **Upload your CSV file and enter a query:**

    - Example query: `Find the linear regression function to estimate cost based on labor and machines.`

4. **View the regression equation, model summary, and predictions.**

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `utils.py`: Contains the `query_agent` function to handle CSV parsing, query interpretation, and linear regression analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `.env`: Contains the OpenAI API key (not included in the repository).

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the application:

1. **Upload a CSV file with columns like `COST`, `LABOR`, `MACHINE`, etc.**

2. **Enter a query:**

    ```
    Find the linear regression function to estimate cost based on labor and machines.
    ```

3. **The application will display:**

    - The linear regression equation.
    - A summary of the regression model.
    - Predictions based on the model.
